This repository demonstrates a common error in Python code: failing to handle non-numeric input when calculating an average. The `bug.py` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a robust solution.  The issue is that a TypeError arises if the input list contains anything other than numbers. The solution addresses this by using a `try-except` block for error handling and data validation.
